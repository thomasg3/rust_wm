//! Optional: Gaps

//! Extend your window manager with support for gaps, i.e. the ability to add
//! some space between the different tiles. See the documentation of the
//! [`GapSupport`] trait for the precise requirements.
//!
//! Make a copy of your tiling window manager from assignment B and let it
//! implement the [`GapSupport`] trait. You are not required to let this
//! window manager implement all the previous traits.
