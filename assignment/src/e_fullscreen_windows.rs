//! Optional: Fullscreen Windows
//!
//! Extend your window manager with support for fullscreen windows, i.e. the
//! ability to temporarily make a window take up the whole screen, thereby
//! obscuring all other windows. See the documentation of the
//! [`FullscreenSupport`] trait for the precise requirements. Don't confuse
//! this with the first assignment, in which you built a window manager that
//! displayed all windows fullscreen.
//!
//! Like in the previous assignments, either make a copy of, or define a
//! wrapper around your previous window manager to implement the
//! [`FullscreenSupport`] trait as well. Note that this window manager must
//! still implement all the traits from previous assignments.

//! # Status

//! or you want to explain your approach, write it down after the comments
//! section.

/// **TODO**: You are free to choose the name for your window manager. As we
