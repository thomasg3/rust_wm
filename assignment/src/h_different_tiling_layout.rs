//! Optional: Different Tiling Layout
//!
//! Come up with a different tiling layout algorithm than the one you have
//! already implemented. If you are uninspired, feel free to look for one on
//! the [internet], but *don't forget to mention where you found it*. The
//! layout algorithm *may not be trivial*, e.g., not just adding tiles by
//! splitting the screen horizontally, and must be at least as complex as, but
//! different enough from the original layout algorithm you already had to
//! implement.
//!
//! Make a copy of your tiling window manager that implements the tiling
//! layout algorithm. This window manager has to implement the
//! [`WindowManager`] trait, but *not necessarily* the [`TilingSupport`]
//! trait, as not every layout has a master tile. Feel free to add additional
//! methods to your window manager that can be used to manipulate its layout.
//! You are not required to let this window manager implement all the previous
//! traits.
