//! Minimising Windows
//!
//! Extend your window manager with support for (un)minimising windows. i.e.
//! the ability to temporarily hide windows and to reveal them again later.
//! See the documentation of the [`MinimiseSupport`] trait for the precise
//! requirements.
//!
//! Either make a copy of the tiling window manager with support for floating
//! windows you developed in the previous assignment and let it implement the
//! [`MinimiseSupport`] trait as well, or implement this trait by building a
//! wrapper around the previous window manager. Note that this window manager
//! must still implement all the traits from previous assignments.
