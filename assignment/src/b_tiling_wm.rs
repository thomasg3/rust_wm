//! Tiling Window Manager
//!
//! Write a more complex window manager that will *tile* its windows. Tiling
//! is described in the first section of the assignment. Your window manager
//! must implement both the [`WindowManager`] trait and the [`TilingSupport`]
//! trait. See the documentation of the [`TilingSupport`] trait for the
//! precise requirements and an explanation of the tiling layout algorithm.
