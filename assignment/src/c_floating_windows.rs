//! Floating Windows
//!
//! Extend your window manager with support for floating windows, i.e. windows
//! that do not tile but that you move around and resize with the mouse. These
//! windows will *float* above the tiles, e.g. dialogs, popups, video players,
//! etc. See the documentation of the [`FloatSupport`] trait for the precise
//! requirements.
//!
//! Either make a copy of the tiling window manager you developed in the
//! previous assignment and let it implement the [`FloatSupport`] trait as
//! well, or implement the [`FloatSupport`] trait by building a wrapper around
//! your tiling window manager. This way you won't have to copy paste code.
//! Note that this window manager must still implement the [`TilingSupport`]
//! trait.
